# FastRounding.jl
Faster directed rounding for inline arithmetic

## Quick Overview

* What we do is what Julia already does.  We do it considerably faster.

* This package provides arithmetic with directed rounding    

* These arithmetic operations are supported:  { +, -, *, inv, /, sqrt }     

* These directed rounding modes are supported    
  { RoundNearest, RoundUp, RoundDown, RoundToZero, RoundFromZero }
  


We calculate two results of the LLVM's directed roundingbuilt-in  provides directed rounding for the basic arithmetic operations.

To perform arithmetic with directed rounding more rapidly than the LLVM allows, 
we provide our own directed rounding control and calculation for arithmetic operations.
manner of calculation  arithmetic with directed rounding results use error-free transformations to control rounding
      and quick, accurate float adjacency value calculation.

#### RoundNearest

| sign of `hi` | sign of `lo` | rounding | fastrounding |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| +  | +   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| +  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | +   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |

#### RoundDown

| sign of `hi` | sign of `lo` | rounding | fastrounding |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| +  | +   | `hi` | `hi` |
| +  | -   | `prevfloat(hi)`  | `next_nearerto_zero(hi) == prev_float(hi)` |
| -  | +   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | -   | `prevfloat(hi)`  | `next_awayfrom_zero(hi) == prev_float(hi)` |

#### RoundUp

| sign of `hi` | sign of `lo` | rounding | fastrounding |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| +  | +   | `nextfloat(hi)` | `next_awayfrom_zero(hi) == next_float(hi)` |
| +  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | +   | `nextfloat(hi)` | `next_nearerto_zero(hi) == next_float(hi)` |
| -  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |

#### RoundFromZero

| sign of `hi` | sign of `lo` | rounding | fastrounding |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| +  | +   | `nextfloat(hi)` | `next_awayfrom_zero(hi)` |
| +  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | +   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| -  | -   | `prevfloat(hi)` |  `next_awayfrom_zero(hi)` |


####  RoundToZero

| sign of `hi` | sign of `lo` | rounding | fastrounding |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| +  | +   | `hi`  | `hi` |
| +  | -   | `prevfloat(hi)` |  `next_nearerto_zero(hi)` |
| -  | +   | `nextfloat(hi)` | `next_nearerto_zero(hi)` |
| -  | -   | `hi`  | `hi` |
